I can't see what's behind
those eyes
Just wait, talk a little
before they're right
誰かの理想像に
耳を傾けてしまったの
I can't take it back no more
I guess
it's too late to call it off
感情の無い世界に溺れてさ
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
I'm lost without your honesty
I'm stuck between yes and no
Don't let me down
This is what you came for
狂ったように舞いな
"Said you wanna be a Superstar"
Show me
you won't break and fall apart
Take me higher, higher
Show me
you won't break and fall apart
何かを言おうとして
間違い探しのスタート合図
Why's everybody's eyes on me
慣れてしまうものね 視線の的
I can't take it back no more
I guess
it's too late to call it off
感じるプレッシャーは
押し殺してさ
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
I'm lost without your honesty
いい子気取りじゃ No no no
Don't let me down
This is what you came for
狂ったように舞いな
"Said you wanna be a Superstar"
Show me
you won't break and fall apart
Take me higher, higher
Show me
you won't break and fall apart
"Said you wanna be a Superstar"
"So show me what you got"
I can't take it back no more
I guess
it's too late to call it off
感情の無い世界に溺れてさ
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
I'm lost without your honesty
I'm stuck between yes and no
Don't let me down
This is what you came for
狂ったように舞いな
"Said you wanna be a Superstar"
Show me
you won't break and fall apart
Take me higher, higher
Show me
you won't break and fall apart
